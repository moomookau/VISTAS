## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Regression

1.  Click on Regression in the navigation bar.

2.  Select two different variables to be shown on the regression plot, one for y axis and one for x axis e.g. Employment Growth and Industry Migration.

3.  Select filters to be applied on the dataset. The filters include year, country, region, income level, industry section and skill group.

4.  By default, all options are selected for each filter. On each filter, there are buttons to select all, deselect all or select individual options. Selected options will have a tick next to it.

5.  If the selected filters produce no data point, '0 rows selected' will be reflected and you will not be able to apply changes to generate the visualisation. Select the appropriate filters to ensure results.

6.  Once the variables and filters are selected, click on 'Apply changes'.

7.  The spinning wheel indicates that the regression plot and results are being generated. Once completed, the visualisations will be shown.

## Scatterplot

1.  Click on Scatter Plot in the navigation bar.

2.  Select two different variables to be shown on the interactive scatter plot, one for y axis and one for x axis e.g. Employment Growth and Industry Migration.

3.  Select filters to be applied on the dataset. The filters include year, country, region, income level, industry section and skill group.

4.  By default, all options are selected for each filter. On each filter, there are buttons to select all, deselect all or select individual options. Selected options will have a tick next to it.

5.  If the selected filters produce no data point, '0 rows selected' will be reflected and you will not be able to apply changes to generate the visualisation. Select the appropriate filters to ensure results.

6.  Once the variables and filters are selected, click on 'Apply changes'.

7.  The spinning wheel indicates that the interactive scatter plot is being generated. Once completed, the visualisation will be shown.

8.  Hover over each point on the interactive scatter plot to find out its values i.e. x variable, y variable, year, country, industry and skill.

9.  There are buttons on the interactive scatter plot to carry out actions e.g. download plot as png, zoom, select.

## Correlation Matrix

1.  Click on Correlation Matrix in the navigation bar.

2.  Four variables will be used for the correlation matrix i.e. GDP per capita growth, Employment growth, Industry migration and Skill migration.

3.  Select filters to be applied on the dataset. The filters include year, country, region, income level, industry section and skill group.

4.  By default, all options are selected for each filter. On each filter, there are buttons to select all, deselect all or select individual options. Selected options will have a tick next to it.

5.  If the selected filters produce no data point, '0 rows selected' will be reflected and you will not be able to apply changes to generate the visualisation. Select the appropriate filters to ensure results.

6.  Once the variables and filters are selected, click on 'Apply changes'.

7.  The spinning wheel indicates that the correlation matrix is being generated. Once completed, the visualisation will be shown.

## Choropleth Map

1.  Click on Choropleth Map in the navigation bar.
2.  Select Type of Migration to View from the dropdown -- Country, Industry or Skill.
3.  Select Base Country i.e. the country you want to see the net migration for. The dropdown list is sorted by Region then alphabetical order.
4.  Select Year on the slider as the data covers years 2015 -- 2019 (both years included).
5.  Select Colour by from the dropdown. This variable determines the shades you see on the map. When Bins is selected, you can further indicate the number of bins. o When Quantile is selected, you can further indicate the number of quantiles. o When Numeric is selected, no further options are available.
6.  Select Colour Palette to watch the colours of the choropleth map change.

## Chord Diagram

1.  Click on the Chord Diagram in the navigation bar.
2.  Select at least three countries from the dropdown list for Countries.
3.  Select Year on the slider as the data covers years 2015 -- 2019 (both years included).
4.  Select Order by Income Group or Region.
5.  Select Migration Perspective inwards or outwards.

## Slope Graph

1.  Click on Slope Graph in the navigation bar.

2.  Select Type of Migration to View from the dropdown -- Country, Industry or Skill.

3.  Select Base Country i.e. the country you want to see the net migration for. The dropdown list is sorted by Region then alphabetical order.

4.  Select Top, Bottom or Top and Bottom.

    -   Indicate the number of countries (N) you want to see on your slope graph.
    -   When "Top and Bottom" is selected, Top N and Bottom N countries are shown.

5.  Select Colour by Region or Income Group. This variable determines the colors of the lines on the slope graph.

6.  Check Pseudolog Y-Axis to transform the y-axis. Pseudolog allows for a log-like transformation for both negative and positive values on the slope graph; visually, this feature results in lines on the slope graph being less cluttered.

## Treemap

1.  Click on Treemap in the navigation bar.
2.  Select Type of Migration to View from the dropdown -- Country, Industry or Skill.
3.  Select Base Country i.e. the country you want to see the net migration for. The dropdown list is sorted by Region then alphabetical order.
4.  Select Year on the slider as the data covers years 2015 -- 2019 (both years included).
5.  Select Group by Region or Income Group to see the hierarchy in the treemap. Click on the rectangles to go down a level in the hierarchy, click on the top header to go up a level in the hierarchy.
6.  Select Size By Population or GDP Per Capita. This determines the size of the rectangles in the treemap.
7.  Select Colour Palette to watch the colours of the choropleth map change.

## Geofacet

1.  Click on Geofacet in the navigation bar.

2.  Select Type of Migration to View from the dropdown -- Country, Industry or Skill.

    -   When Country is selected, you must further select Base Country i.e. the country you want to see the net migration for. The dropdown list is sorted by Region then alphabetical order.
    -   When Industry is selected, you must further select the Industries you want to see the net migration for.
    -   When Skills is selected, you must further select the Skills you want to see the net migration for.

3.  Select the Region(s) you would like to see geofacets for. The select region(s) will show on the visualization.

4.  Once you have selected the above, click on "Render!". The spinning wheel indicates that the geofacets are loading. Once completed, the visualization will show.

5.  To reset your selections for Industry migration and Skills migration, go to Type of Migration to View, select country, then the industries and skills that you've selected will reset. Then repeat Steps 2-4 again.
