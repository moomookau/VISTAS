## Proposal

This post https://va.moomookau.org/posts/2021-02-21-visual-analytics-project-proposal/ contains the proposal for VISTAS - Visualising Industry Skill TAlent Shifts.

In the post, you can find the background, project motivation and earlier sketches of our project. The final shiny dashboard differs as we explore more R packages with greater interactivity and work towards creating a user-friendly analytical tool.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
